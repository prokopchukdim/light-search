# LightSearch
A lightweight search plug-in built in and for Sublime Text 4. Inspired by WebSearch and Google Search for Sublime, but combines command functionality into one multipurpose command.

Currently supports: 
- Custom search queries into search engines using the LightSearch: Search command in the Command Palette. Current highlighted text is automatically given as the default argument for convenience.
- Search using keybindings or the Command Palette
- 5 common search engines (Google, Stackoverflow, duckduckgo, Bing, Yahoo). Support easily extendable in package settings. Can choose current engine using the LightSearch: Choose Engine command

Note on keybindings:
- keybindings are commented out by default to follow Sublime packaging regulations. You must uncomment them in Default.sublime-keymap in the installation path to use them.
